            With its clear water sources and permanent springs, rocks resembling ancient statues, and fauna including the Barbary macaque, crow, sparrowhawk, and other birds of prey, as well as its lush spring flora and multihundred-year-old olive trees, all set against a unique panorama of the Mediterranean Sea and Rif Mountains, the Douar Boujmil is an exceptional site to be preserved. Located at an altitude of 150 meters and with Mount Boujmil's peak reaching 681 meters, with beautiful views of the Mediterranean, Boujmil is part of the Monte Blanco mountain range. This still relatively unknown site is the perfect space for a return to nature, which we all need!
